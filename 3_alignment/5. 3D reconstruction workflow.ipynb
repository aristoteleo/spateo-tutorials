    "Typical Spateo's 3D reconstruction workflow involves the following steps: loading data, preprocessing, pairwise rigid alignment, check the results, multi-slice refinement, nonrigid alignment, mesh correction, and visualization. Among these, multi-slice refinement, nonrigid alignment, and mesh correction are optional steps and may not be necessary in some cases. If you want to achieve better reconstruction results, you can try these steps. Once completed, the reconstructed model can be applied to downstream analyses. \n",
